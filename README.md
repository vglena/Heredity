# üß¨ Heredity AI: Gene and Trait Probability Calculator

This project calculates the probability distributions of genes and traits in a family using **Bayesian inference** and **probabilistic reasoning**.  
Given family data and known traits, the AI computes the probability that each person has 0, 1, or 2 copies of a gene, and whether they exhibit a particular trait.

---

## üìñ Overview

The program uses a dataset of family relationships and traits:

- Each CSV file in `data/` contains columns: `name`, `mother`, `father`, `trait`.  
- The trait column can be `1` (has trait), `0` (does not have trait), or empty (unknown).  
- Using **conditional probabilities**, **mutations**, and the **law of inheritance**, the AI calculates probabilities for each person.

The project focuses on computing:

1. **Joint probabilities** ‚Äì Probability of a specific configuration of genes and traits across all family members.  
2. **Updates** ‚Äì Adding new evidence to existing probability distributions.  
3. **Normalization** ‚Äì Ensuring all probability distributions sum to 1 while maintaining relative proportions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The project contains the following main file:

### `heredity.py`

- **joint_probability(people, one_gene, two_genes, have_trait)**  
  Computes the joint probability of a specific assignment of genes and traits for all people in the dataset.  
  - Accounts for inheritance from parents if available.  
  - Considers mutation probabilities.  
  - Uses conditional probabilities for traits based on gene counts.

- **update(probabilities, one_gene, two_genes, have_trait, p)**  
  Adds a new joint probability `p` to the existing probability distributions for each person.

- **normalize(probabilities)**  
  Normalizes all gene and trait distributions so that each sums to 1, preserving relative proportions.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```python
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heredity-ai.git
cd heredity-ai
```
2. Install dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the AI:
```python
python heredity.py data/family0.csv
```
- Outputs the probability distribution for each person‚Äôs gene count and trait.

## üß© Dependencies / Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- No third-party libraries required, though numpy or pandas can be used for additional analysis (optional)

Example `requirements.txt`:
```python
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0
```
## üí° Notes

- `PROBS` dictionary defines all relevant probabilities:
  - Gene distribution: Probability a person has 0, 1, or 2 copies of the gene without parental information.
  - Trait distribution: Probability a person exhibits a trait given their gene count.
  - Mutation probability: Chance a gene mutates when passed from parent to child.
- The AI calculates probabilities by:
  - Enumerating all possible gene/trait combinations.
  - Multiplying the relevant probabilities for each person.
  - Summing over combinations consistent with known evidence.
  - Normalizing the resulting distributions.
